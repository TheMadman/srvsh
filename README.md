# Server Shell - srvsh

Server Shell - `srvsh` - is a program that interprets a shell script, using a special syntax, to connect programs together. It also provides a library for writing `srvsh` commands, which are totally stand-alone applications.

For a file called `script.srv` with the following content:

```
ls -l
```

It starts the program `ls` with the argument `-l`.

Modifying the script like so:

```
ls -l
cat script.srv
```

Begins both programs _concurrently._ Server shell does not wait for the first program to finish before starting the second program.

## Server/Client Programs

If all that `srvsh` did was start programs, it wouldn't be very interesting. The interesting feature is that it also sets up IPC connections between programs, based on a special syntax.

POSIX shells provide syntax to create pipelines of commands, where the standard input from the command line (or a file) is fed into the first command, and it produces standard output. Its standard output is fed into the standard input of the second command, which produces standard output, and so on:

```bash
cat foo.txt bar.txt | grep "Hello" | wc
```

The programs do not need to be written to have knowledge of where their standard input is coming from, or where their standard output is going to. They just have to read from file descriptor 0, set up by the shell for them, and write to file descriptor 1, also set up by the shell.

`srvsh` does not support pipelines, or redirecting standard input/standard output. What it does instead, is open new file descriptors to map a parent/child or server/client relationship, between a single parent/server and multiple child/client processes, with a syntax that looks like this:

```
server {
    client-1
    client-2
    # etc.
}
```

In this case, every process has a file descriptor 3, which is used to both read from and write to the server process. `server`'s server process is the shell itself, which currently doesn't read or write any data at all. `client-1` and `client-2` both have a file descriptor 3, which allows them to read and write data to `server`.

The server processes have file descriptors open for each child. In this case, `server` has a file descriptor 4 for `client-1`, and a file descriptor 5 for `client-2`, where it can read and write data to each of the clients.

A client library is also provided to conveniently work with the connections established by the shell. A server can discover how many clients it has by calling the library function `cli_count()`.

The shell supports arbitrarily nesting these commands:

```
server {
    middleware-1 {
        client-1
        client-2
    }
    client-3
}
```

The library provides the interface defined in [srvsh.h](src/srvsh/srvsh.h).
